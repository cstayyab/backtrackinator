# Backtrackinator

Never lose your place again! Backtrackinator remembers your last visited page on a website and takes you back there with a single click.

## Installation

Backtrackinator can be installed from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/backtrackinator/dcfopkiapgjmglehdcolghgchkdnjjog).

## About

Backtrackinator was my first experiment to use ChatGPT (using GPT-3) to write a Chrome extension. ChatGPT helped me with the code and documentation, and I intervened only when there was confusion or a need to update the requirements. Initially, I started with complex requirements but later simplified the extension to its current form.

As a user, you can simply click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar, and the extension will take you to the last visited page of the current website. This extension does not have a settings page, and no data is stored locally. 

## Possible Improvements
* Ability to exclude certain websites from being tracked: Allow users to specify which websites they don't want to be tracked by the extension, either by adding them to a list in the extension's settings or by using a toggle on the extension popup.

* **Option to clear tracking data**: Give users the ability to clear their saved tracking data on a per-website basis or for all websites at once.

* **Keyboard shortcut for opening last page**: Allow users to set a custom keyboard shortcut for quickly opening the last visited page on a website.

* **Integration with bookmarking**: Allow users to add their last visited page on a website as a bookmark directly from the extension popup.

* **Syncing tracking data across devices**: If the user is signed in to Google Chrome, allow them to sync their tracking data across all their devices.

* **Improve accuracy of tracking**: Currently, the extension only tracks the last visited page on a website, even if the user has multiple tabs open. Future versions of the extension could track the last visited page on a per-tab basis, improving the accuracy of the feature.

* **Option to track history from a longer period**: Currently, the extension only tracks the last visited page on a website from the previous session. In the future, it could track the last visited page from the past week, month or even longer, depending on user preference.
